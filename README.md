# FunctionalNetlistingof-VSDBABYSoC


## FUNCTIONAL SIMULATION

A functional simulation simulates the design description to verify its logical correctness. A circuit represented in the form of logic expressions can be simulated to verify that it will function as expected. The tool that performs this task is called a functional simulator.
